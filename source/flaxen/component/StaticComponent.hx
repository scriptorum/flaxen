package flaxen.component;

/**
 * Extend this class to create a singleton/static component. Although it doesn't look it,
 * this is a component with a private constructor and a single static instance. Therefore, this:
 *
 * 	class Hungry extends StaticComponent {}
 *
 * is the same as writing:
 *
 * 	class Hungry
 * 	{
 *         public static function instance:Hungry = new Hungry();
 *         private function new() { }	
 * 	}
 *
 * See Macro.buildSingleton() for how this modifies a class defined using @:build. 
 * Because it's @:autoBuild, buildSingleton() then will act upon any class that extends 
 * THIS class, which is very convenient.
 *
 * This class is also useful for building Controls, which are components that - by their existence - 
 * permit systems to run. For example, add a CanFireWeapon.instance to an Entity, and the FireSystem
 * can call flaxen.hasControl(CanFireWeapon) to determine whether or not to process.
