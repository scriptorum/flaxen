#Flaxen
##Overview
> You've got Haxepunk in my Ash! You got Ash in my Haxepunk!

Flaxen blends an entity-component-system with a Haxe-based game engine, powered by [HaxePunk](https://github.com/HaxePunk/HaxePunk) and [Ash](https://github.com/nadako/Ash-HaXe). 

### Features
* A full entity-component-system based on Ash lets you focus on data-driven game design.
* Built-in components/systems handle the display of integrated HaxePunk graphics.
* Support for images, maps, backdrops, text, bitmapped text, particle emitters and sound.
* Common components for altering attributes like position, transparency, rotation, and scaling.
* Tweens, action queues, mode transitions, dependencies, component sets, and more!

A user guide is up [on the wiki](https://github.com/scriptorum/flaxen/wiki). The [API](http://scriptorum.github.io/flaxen/dox/flaxen/Flaxen.html) is ... we'll call it a work in progress.
